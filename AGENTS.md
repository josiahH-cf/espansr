# AGENTS

Canonical entrypoint for all coding agents. Read this first, then follow links to detailed references.

## Overview

`espansr` is a Python CLI + GUI manager for Espanso command templates, focused on fast command authoring, safe validation/sync workflows, and stable cross-platform behavior for developer productivity.

## Stable Maintenance Path

`espansr` is public, mostly built, and normally maintained as a stable solo-maintainer project. Routine upkeep should be lightweight: when the user asks for a focused template, prompt, documentation, or small workflow correction, agents may handle it directly as Phase 8 maintenance without creating a new feature spec or task file.

Routine maintenance includes:

- Adding, editing, or removing bundled templates in `templates/`.
- Updating Copilot/Claude prompts, agent instructions, or workflow wording for clarity.
- Documentation-only updates and small corrections to existing workflow files.
- Small non-behavioral cleanups that do not alter application features, security posture, or repository governance.

For routine maintenance, the agent should read `AGENTS.md`, `workflow/STATE.json`, and the relevant canonical files before editing; inspect current git state; make focused changes; run the relevant checks from `workflow/COMMANDS.md`; summarize the diff; and, when explicitly requested and local permissions/repository state allow, commit, push, open a PR, and complete the merge path safely. If unrelated work is already present, permissions are missing, CI is unavailable, or branch protection/review policy prevents completion, stop after verification and report the required manual step.

Route larger user-facing features through Phases 2-7, bugs through the Bug Track, and governance changes that alter policy/safeguards through `governance/CHANGE_PROTOCOL.md`.

## Workflow Phases

The project lifecycle follows 9 phases plus a parallel Bug Track.

### Phase 1 — Scaffold Import
- **Entry:** Run `initialization.md` meta-prompt
- **Gate:** Empty or new project repository → **Output:** Scaffold files placed → **Next:** Phase 2

### Phase 2 — Compass
- **Entry:** Claude: `/compass` · Copilot: `phase-2-compass.prompt.md` · Codex: `.codex/AGENTS.md`
- **Gate:** Scaffold present → **Output:** `.specify/constitution.md` populated (themes addressed, ambiguities documented) → **Next:** Phase 3

### Phase 3 — Define Features
- **Entry:** Claude: `/define-features` · Copilot: `phase-3-define-features.prompt.md`
- **Gate:** Constitution complete → **Output:** Feature specs in `/specs/` → **Next:** Phase 4

### Phase 4 — Scaffold Project
- **Entry:** Claude: `/scaffold` · Copilot: `phase-4-scaffold.prompt.md`
- **Gate:** Feature specs exist → **Output:** Architecture plan, `workflow/COMMANDS.md` finalized (no code) → **Next:** Phase 5

### Phase 5 — Fine-tune Plan
- **Entry:** Claude: `/fine-tune` · Copilot: `phase-5-fine-tune.prompt.md`
- **Gate:** Scaffold plan exists → **Output:** `/tasks/` files with AC, model, branch → **Next:** Phase 6

### Phase 6 — Code
- **Entry:** Claude: `/implement` · Copilot: `phase-6-implement.prompt.md`
- `/implement` is **direct single-feature execution** — use when you know which feature to build
- **Session mode:** `/build-session` — sustained multi-feature implementation session
- **Gate:** Task file + pre-impl tests exist → **Output:** Passing code on feature branch → **Next:** Phase 7

### Phase 7 — Test
- **Entry:** Claude: `/test` · Copilot: `phase-7-test.prompt.md`
- **Gate:** Implementation on feature branch → **Output:** Test results, bug log → **Next:** Phase 7a

### Phase 7a — Review Bot (Default Review Path)
- **Entry:** Claude: `/review-bot` · Copilot: `phase-7a-review-bot.prompt.md`
- **Automatic:** `/continue` dispatches here after tests pass — no manual trigger needed
- **On-demand:** `/review-bot` to run manually at any time
- **Gate:** All ACs pass → **Output:** PR merged when permissions/repository rules allow, PR ready when blocked, or findings file at `/reviews/[feature-id]-bot-findings.md` (on FAIL) → **Next:** Phase 8 or next feature after merge; back to Phase 6 on findings
- **Agent:** `.github/agents/review-bot.agent.md` — prefer a different model than the implementer (advisory)

### Phase 7b — Review & Ship (Manual Fallback)
- **Entry:** Claude: `/review-session` · Copilot: `phase-7d-review-session.prompt.md`
- **Optional:** `/cross-review` — second-opinion review from a different agent
- **Use when:** Manual human review is desired (security-critical, architectural changes)
- **Gate:** All ACs pass → **Output:** Approved PR merged → **Next:** Phase 8 or next feature

### Phase 8 — Maintain
- **Entry:** Claude: `/maintain` · Copilot: `phase-8-maintain.prompt.md`
- **Gate:** Feature shipped or routine stable-maintenance request → **Output:** Focused update, verification evidence, optional PR/merge when safe → **Next:** Phase 9 when automation setup is requested, otherwise ongoing maintenance

### Phase 9 — Operationalize
- **Entry:** Claude: `/operationalize` · Copilot: `phase-9-operationalize.prompt.md`
- **Gate:** Maintenance level selected → **Output:** `.github/maintenance-config.yml` + generated GitHub Actions workflows → **Next:** Ongoing (re-enterable)
- **Interview:** Covers lint schedule, docs compliance, release publishing, dependency monitoring, security scanning, notification routing, automation depth
- **Re-entry:** Run `/operationalize` again to update existing config — no duplication

### Bug Track (Parallel)
- **Entry:** Claude: `/bug` · Copilot: `phase-7b-bug.prompt.md` — invoke from any phase
- **Fix flow:** `/bugfix` — reproduce → diagnose → fix → verify → PR

### Orchestrator
- **Entry:** Claude: `/continue` · Copilot: `phase-10-continue.prompt.md`
- `/continue` is the **orchestrator**, not a direct implementation command. It reads `workflow/STATE.json`, determines the next action (including bug-routing), dispatches to the appropriate phase command, and auto-advances through phases 2–9. At Phase 6 it delegates to `/implement`.
